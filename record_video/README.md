This routine provides the simplest code idea and method to record video with XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, for reference only. The recorded video may need to use a specific player to be playable (e.g. IINA) as the decoder is not added to this routine.

If you need to use XIAO ESP32S3 Sense for the following tasks, use the procedure in [record_video_decorder](https://github.com/limengdu/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3-Sense-camera/tree/main/record_video_decorder/).

1. Record audio and video footage at the same time.
2. Recorded videos can be played using common players.

This programme is compatible with esp-arduino 2.0.x as well as 3.0.x.
